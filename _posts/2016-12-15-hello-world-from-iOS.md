```python
print('Hello world!')
```

I didn't think I'd find myself typing that code into a remote [git](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository from my iPhone, but here I am. I've been trying to make aspects of my work more mobile friendly, to avoid the need to drag my laptop with me everywhere I travel. I think this may be the piece that cracks the code. Sometimes I make heavy use of it, but for shorter trips it can be a bit of a burden to bring just to update something small on the road. I've gone iPad only at a week long conference once before, which was a bit tricky.

I think I may have finally stumbled across a bit of software that would make this dream a bit more possible. The iOS app [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) allows connecting to remote Git repositories such as [Github](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) for cloning repositories. Local edits can be made, sharing files with other editing apps, with commits pushed back upstream! I've moved much of my writing and work into git for revision control, which meshes perfectly with this workflow[^1]. Now I can maybe think about leaving my laptop behind for short trips, with the knowledge that basic editing is only an iOS keyboard away.
