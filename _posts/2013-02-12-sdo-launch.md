Monday, 11 February 2013 was the third anniversary of the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory [SDO]. For those of us in the solar physics community, this was a spectacular event on launch day. It was a fraught with perils and excitement, followed by a waiting period to see if the damn thing worked. In the end, there were photons, and we gained a valuable new lens on the sun.

What makes SDO so important, then? SDO is a major component of NASA's Living with a Star [LWS] program. Given that we (and everyone you know, everyone alive, and everyone who has ever existed) live in the extended atmosphere of the sun, understanding the connection between the sun and Earth is crucially important. SDO has a number of instruments to support this mission, and to more fully understand this connection.

The Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment [EVE] is one of the three major instruments on board SDO. EVE is a spectrometer of sorts, meaning that it doesn't relay back gorgeous images of the sun. What it does send back is just as important, however. The sun emits in an entire continuum of wavelengths, and the EVE instrument looks at a particular band of wavelengths. Within that band, EVE will return the intensity (collected from the entire visible disk of the sun) at each particular wavelength, with a resolution of one angstrom. Part of the problem with imaging devices is the staggering amount of data sent back. Mining through that takes time, computers, graduate students, and prodigious quantities of coffee. EVE is designed to look at the sun's output as a whole (in a particular band of wavelengths), and to monitor the evolution of that output over time. It can study long-term trends, as well as the global effects a localized flare can potentially have.

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager [HMI] is an imagining device in nature. However, this device observes certain wavelengths to calculate the magnetic field of the sun, and other quantities. This instrument observes the components of the magnetic field (with some ambiguities as to pointing and magnitude) and with some clever calculations can pinpoint a nearly correct field. Now, this magnetic field is calculated near the photosphere of the sun, what you see as the visible disk with the human eye. HMI is crucially important to the work I do, as I take this photospheric magnetic field information, and extrapolate it upward into the solar corona.

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly [AIA] is more along the lines of what the public wants, and what we need to share, gorgeous images of the sun. Visible light is just one of the filters that AIA can view the sun in, with the majority being wavelengths our eyes can't observe. Unlike EVE, which is able to resolve wavelengths down to the angstrom level, the filters on AIA are a bit different. They gather a bit of a wider range, and can represent the emission from plasma at a range of temperatures, depending on the atomic transitions at hand. Despite these limitations, we end up with gorgeous images of the sun, that can also yield important plasma diagnostics and visual tracking of phenomena.

All of these instruments generate a mountain of data, which requires a dedicated base station to receive the data. Not only that, but large server arrays are required to store and mirror the data. Entire teams are devoted just towards the computing requirements of the SDO dataset.

SDO should remain operational for the next few years, sending back terabytes of data every day. Researchers will continue to mine through this data for years to come, until the next large solar observatory mission. One can only speculate about what new observable features we'll discover.

This truly is an exciting era in solar physics.
