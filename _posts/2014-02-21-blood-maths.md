I had to reschedule a blood donation appointment the other day, and in doing so had to reset my Red Cross donation account. I must have created it years ago, and must have forgotten the password shortly thereafter. The account logged my past blood donations with the Red Cross, and that made me curious about volumes.

There's a record of 12 blood donations, one of those being a double unit donation. A standard blood donation is 470 mL, just around a pint. Doing some quick maths, that's 6110 mL, or roughly a gallon and a half.

I've gotten fairly serious about donating as often as I can for the past year, which is once every 56 days. If I kept up this trend until I was 76 years old, that would be another 313 donations. Of course this is assuming that we won't develop a method of artificially growing blood in large quantities within my lifetime. With each donation being roughly 470 mL, and factoring in my previous donations, that sums up to a grand total of 153,220 mL or about 40 gallons. That's roughly the volume of a bathtub.

That's a lot of blood. But people need it. Donate blood.
