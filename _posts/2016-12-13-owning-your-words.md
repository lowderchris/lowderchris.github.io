About once a year I entertain the idea of writing some sort of blog. I feel as though I need some sort of conduit to pour out ideas and words, meaningful or not, to electronic paper. I write up a few paragraphs or pages, push the result out, and then forget about the idea for another year. This seems to repeat like clockwork.

I wonder if a part of that is platform angst. The idea that after getting my words together, I’ve got to fumble around with uploading that data to somewhere in the cloud. Somewhere with a set of formatting and data management that I don’t have control over. I think a part of that might drive me away from continually updating. I enjoy writing, I hardly enjoy futzing around with arcane Wordpress settings to change paragraph spacing.

In contrast; I do enjoy building tools to solve problems in work and life. I *do* enjoy writing up a bit of CSS to dovetail that perfect font into place. And I think therein lies the solution to my problem. I couldn’t step back and admire the craft of the object as a whole; it was always my words shoved into someone else’s tangled mess of a platform.

At the end of the day I want my words to be storable in plaintext, unmarred by formatting that might disappear in a few years time. I want an archive of writing that I can keep for posterity (no matter how terrible). A system without advertisements and other compromises of design. I want that font I’ve always dreamed of, that slightly off-white background color that speaks to my soul.

And if I can’t find exactly what I’m looking for… I can always build it.
