It's been quite a while since I've updated this blog. To be fair, I have been a bit busy in the interim. I've successfully defended my PhD in that time, and made my way out of Bozeman before the inevitable winter rolled through. Across the Atlantic ocean, lies a small island nation, where now I'm working at Durham University as a postdoc with the numerical analysis research group. After a crisp Autumn and a relatively mild beginning to Winter, I started to wonder about the patterns of weather here in Durham. After a quick visit to the Met office, via the web and in-person (for another purpose), I grabbed a few files with the climate data for Durham spanning 1880-2015.

The historical temperature records over the course of the year was my first consideration, tracking the highs (red) and lows (blue) averaged through each month. To present this data, a box-and-whisker plot was employed. Taking a range of data, in this case the monthly averaged temperatures, the arranged values can be divided into four equal groups named quartiles. The top and bottom of each notched box represent the first and third quartile mark, with the second quartile as the line within. The whiskers extending from each box show the full range of data, excluding outliers which are plotted separately. The whiskers then span nearly the full range of data, with the boxes containing the statistical span of 50% of the data. The notched portion spans the 95% confidence interval, around the central line marking the median value of the data.

So what can we say about the historical temperatures here in Durham? The seasonal changes are immediately visible. Summers peak around a nice and comfortable 20C, with winters dipping down near freezing. The summers are a bit short, but the extended Autumn is more than worth it. I look great in a sweater and scarf... not so much in shorts. To compare with the weather patterns in Bozeman, these data can be overlaid in a lighter shade.

Winter is coming. Immediately the harsh Montana winters are visible in comparison. I've never seen more terrifying outlier points! While the summer months were certainly a bit warmer in Bozeman, which was fantastic for hiking, the winters were a bit more cruel. The descent into winter is much sharper, with a short and snappy Autumn. Of particular note is the fact that for December and January, the median high temperature for Bozeman is equivalent to the median low temperature for Durham!

Looking through the other data gathered for the Durham weather stations, rainfall and sunlight seemed obvious candidates. Using a similar plotting style, the rainfall in mm and monthly hours of sunlight (!) are plotted.

As one might expect, this small island is a bit rainy. The historical rainfall is fairly even throughout the Summer, Autumn, and Winter months. The Spring, oddly enough, seems to have lower levels of rainfall. Outlier points extend higher during the Summer months.

Sunlight data certainly reflects the cloudy and rainy weather that afflicts Britain. Durham, at 54.8 degrees latitude, suffers a great deal from short days in the Winter months. As I'm writing this post for instance, the sun has long-ago set at 3:40pm, and will rise tomorrow morning shortly after 8:00am. I'm certain the long summer days will make up for this.

All things considered, the patterns of weather in Durham seem a bit dreich. Yes, that is a word, and it's certainly now one of my favorites. Having grown up in the blistery hot weather of South Carolina and Georgia, and having endured the Hoth-like winters of Bozeman... I'm certainly enjoying a more mild clime.
