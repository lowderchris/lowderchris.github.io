How could I resist opening this new blog platform up with any other initialization post?

````
print('hello world!')
````

This whole blog is being powered by the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) platform. While there's a little bit of a learning curve in getting things up and running, I think this is exactly the sort of medium I've been looking for[^1]. I'll post more about this torturous journey in the future.

[^1]: No pun intended, certainly.
