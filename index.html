                                <p>Born in the southern United States, I've spent a while wandering far from home. After remaining in Georgia for my undergraduate Physics degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology, I decided to pursue graduate school in Montana. Outside of Appalachia, I quickly discovered what constitutes a mountain out west. There at Montana State University, I completed my M.S. and PhD degrees in Physics. After a move out west, a move east seemed only natural as I worked as a postdoc at Durham University in England. After returning to the States I'm now situated in Boulder, Colorado.<p>
                                <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending my time hiking, camping, (casual) cycling, cooking, and playing board games.</p>

                                <p>Currently I'm working as a Research Scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Here, I'm working with Craig DeForest and Derek Lamb to advance some aspects of the Fluxon model.</p>

                                <p>I've worked with the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University. Here, with Anthony Yeates and the Solar Magnetohydrodyanmics group, my research focused on the automated detection of modeled solar magnetic flux ropes. Through consistent tracking over the course of the solar cycle, we can gather statistics and gauge distinctions between eruptive and non-eruptive flux ropes. This code has been developed online as an open source tool, <a href="https://github.com/lowderchris/FRoDO">FRoDO</a>.</p>

                                <p>My PhD research involved the automated detection of solar coronal holes, features appearing as dark patches in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray imagery. As a source of fast solar wind streams, understanding their dynamics provides insight into their space weather consequences. Linking databases of EUV observations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_Imaging_Telescope">SOHO/EIT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Dynamics_Observatory#Atmospheric_Imaging_Assembly_.28AIA.29">SDO/AIA</a> we provided a database of coronal hole locations and properties stretching back to 1996. Through the multiple vantage points of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO">STEREO</a> spacecraft, nearly full surface maps of coronal hole boundaries were computed on a 12-hour cadence for solar cycle 24. Through comparison of these coronal hole boundaries with computed open magnetic field boundaries, we can shed some insight into underlying physical parameters that drive surface flux transport.</p>
